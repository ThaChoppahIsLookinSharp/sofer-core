# Sofer
Sofer is the outliner tool for programmers. It's focused on being:
- **free** (as in freedom).
- **cross-platform**: the core behaves as the foundation of the front-end apps.
- **simple**: Sofer is based on simple data structures and operations so that you can focus on your
outlining.

Its distinctive features are:
- Every node can read the data in its children and return new data based on that: you can write
little scripts in your node's text and they will be run when the outline is displayed.
- Scripts can be run to change the contents of your nodes.
- Nodes have metadata that can be accessed by scripts or the user.
- Templates can generate new nodes with default metadata fields to speed up complex nodes creation.

These features make Sofer able to do what other outliners already do (task, note, time, habit, etc.
management), but with the power of scripting languages to manage your data. It's like having a
spreadsheet page as your management system.

## Current state
Currently, Sofer it's in its alpha stages, as many of the features above are not yet implemented.
I'm new to open-source development (and to development in general), so if you'd like to contribute
to the project, I would love to talk via email. Pull requests are appreciated.
